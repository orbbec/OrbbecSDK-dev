# Open Source Orbbec SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Welcome to Orbbec's latest open-source Orbbec SDK! Before you begin using this version of the SDK, it's crucial to check the [device support list](#12-supported-devices) to verify that your device is supported to ensure compatibility.

## 1. Introduction

This is the open source library of the Orbbec SDK v2.x. The Orbbec SDK is a cross-platform library for interfacing with the Orbbec RGB-D cameras. It provides C/C++ APIs and many other languages or frameworks [wrappers](wrappers/README.md).

To enhance performance and accommodate the diverse needs of our customers, the Orbbec SDK has been open source since version 2.0.0. For projects currently utilizing version 1.x of the Orbbec SDK that are considering an upgrade to Orbbec SDK v2.x, we advise using the pre-compiled binaries available in the [Release](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2/releases) page. This ensures a seamless transition and maintains consistency with your existing setup.

We have made every effort to maintain backward compatibility with our APIs. However, in pursuit of enhanced performance and an improved user experience, we have made necessary updates. Some interfaces have been removed or altered due to infrequent use or design imperfections. These changes are intended to be minimally disruptive and should not interfere with the standard functionality of the SDK.

For a detailed list of features not available in the current version, please refer to our documentation: [features_not_available_at_v2.x.x](docs/api/features_not_available_at_v2.x.x.md).

Additionally, a comprehensive overview of the API changes from Orbbec SDK v1.x to v2.x.x can be found here: [api_changes_at_v2.x.x](docs/api/api_changes_at_v2.x.x.md).

If you prefer to continue with Orbbec SDK v1.x, you can still access the pre-compiled binaries on our [Orbbec SDK](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK) repository. Nonetheless, we encourage you to consider transitioning to Orbbec SDK v2.x. This move will allow you to take advantage of  improved and new features and ensure ongoing support. Our dedication to v2.x is part of a broader strategy aimed at delivering robust long-term support, fostering an open-source community, and driving innovation.

### 3.1 The QuickStart Example

```c++
// Create a pipeline.
ob::Pipeline pipe;

// Start the pipeline with default config.
pipe.start();

// Create a window for showing the frames, and set the size of the window.
ob_smpl::CVWindow win("QuickStart", 1280, 720, ob_smpl::ARRANGE_ONE_ROW);

while(win.run()) {
    // Wait for frameSet from the pipeline, the default timeout is 1000ms.
    auto frameSet = pipe.waitForFrameset();

    // Push the frames to the window for showing.
    win.pushFramesToView(frameSet);
}

// Stop the Pipeline, no frame data will be generated
pipe.stop();
```
